# Java parser example

This project is an example of the use of javaparser library. 
It scans a project directory searching for java patterns in .java files.

## Initial Steps

Clone the project into a directory in your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/ivan-gayol/javaparser.git
```

Use maven assembly plugin in order to generate the application executable jar file 

```
mvn assembly:assembly -DdescriptorId=jar-with-dependencies
```

You can find now in the target directory the generated jar file

```
javaparser-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
 

### Execution Instructions

Execute the jar as a normal jar file including as parameter the path to the directory of the code you want to analyze

```
 java -jar javaparser-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar [[PATH_TO_YOUR_CODE_DIR]]
```

This should return the results in the console
